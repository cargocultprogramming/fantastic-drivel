## Copyright & Use of content

Any information, documents and descriptions published on this website are the sole and exclusive property of cargocultprg. Permission to use these materials is granted under the  Creative Commons [CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/). If you use this for personal purposes, you can drop the "BY"-clause - which basically means use it however you like with or without attribution, but don't publish derivates under a stricter license than I do. Commercial users: just link back to the original.

I'm not guaranteeing anything about the accuracy or fitness of the published information for any purpose. If you use information from this website and anything goes wrong or has unintended consequences, it's on you.

## Links to other websites

I occasionally link to other websites on different domains. I'm not assuming any responsibility or liability for the materials or information available on these websites.

## Information provided by you

If you send me information as a user of this website, you are fully responsible for this information. That means, that the information you provide is correct and by providing the information you do not violate any rights of third parties. I will not treat anything you send as confidential, except we agree on that.

## Data Protection & Privacy

In accordance the the [GDPR policy of the European Union](https://gdpr.eu/what-is-gdpr/) here is a little text to explain what data is transferred from you, as a user of my homepage, to me and how I'm using it.

While the GDPR is arguably the data protection act that affects the most people, it is not the only one. However since it favours consumer rights over company rights I hope that I'm compliant in most jurisdictions.

## Automated data collection

With any webpage that you are visiting, there are certain data automatically exchanged, like the page you are requesting from the server (the computer that sends this page to you) and your IP address, your phone-number-like address that my server sends this page to. There is also information about your browser, local time, language, screen resolution etc. - these are mostly technical data (as opposed to personal data) that are necessary for the internet to work and for you to be able to see this page. I do not use this data directly for any other purpose than displaying this website and do not pass them knowingly on to third parties. I do my best to protect these data on my server but cannot guarantee data protection in case of third party criminal activity.

## Personal data

I do not record any personal information, except if you actively send me personal data like your name and email to get in contact with me. I will use this data for the sole purpose to communicate with you. I keep the data secure, but cannot guarantee data protection in case of criminal activity.

## Cookies

I'm not recording or reading any cookies related to your personal information. The only cookies I use are technical cookies that ensure the usability and security of my website.

## Applicable law

Place of jurisdiction is Vienna, Austria, European Union.
