I used to keep notes in every project I'm working on. A thousand little tricks and howtos, I'd surely forget until - years later - I find my own question (and sometimes answer) in some dark, forgotten corner of stackoverflow.

I used to spend precious time to remember in which project I stuck that little note about solving issue x... I knew there was a trick, I knew that I wrote that note, alas what did I stick the note to?

I used to copy notes from one project to the next, ruminating the same / similar recipes again and again, forgetting which came first and which came last. Retrying old approaches only to stumble over the same old issues that made me go down a different path before.

So here we go with this little attempt to make things both - more permanent and easier to find, with maintainability hopefully also being part of the mix.

This is barely more than a bunch of notes about things that I personally found useful and want to remember (or at least copypasta) - gists basically, but a bit more palatable hopefully with a minimal sprinkle of design and organization.

Feel free to steal a peace of my mind for yourself and don't forget to pay the love forward.
